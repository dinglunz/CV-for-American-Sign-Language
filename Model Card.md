# Model Card for SignLanguageModel

## 1. Model Details
- **Name:** `ASL Program Python Code`
- **Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Developers:** Zhanqin Ai and Dinglun Zhang, University of Southern California
- **Intended Use:** Recognition and interpretation of American Sign Language (ASL) from images.
- **Input Data Format:** 200x200 pixel RGB images.

## 2. Model Architecture
- **Layers:**
  - Two convolutional layers (16 and 32 filters respectively).
  - Max pooling layers for downsizing.
  - One fully-connected layer with 29 outputs.
  - Dropout layer with a 0.3 rate.
- **Activation Function:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).

## 3. Training
- **Dataset:** Kaggle ASL dataset with 87,000 images representing 29 labels.
- **Training Split:** 70% for training, 15% for validation, 15% for testing.
- **Augmentation Techniques:** Resizing, Color Jittering, ToTensor Transformation, Normalization.
- **Optimization Algorithm:** Adam Optimizer.
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001
- **Epochs:** 10

## 4. Performance Evaluation

- **Validation Strategy:** Employed a split of the test dataset for validation.
- **Performance Measures:** Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix Analysis.
- **Key Observations:** The model demonstrated effective learning and generalization capabilities.

## 5. Ethical Considerations and Limitations
- **Accessibility:** Designed to improve communication for the deaf community.
- **Demographic Bias:** No explicit testing across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups.
- **Limitations:** 
  - The model's accuracy and reliability are subject to the quality and diversity of the training data.
  - Specific performance on intersectional groups has not been documented.
  - Potential risks in real-world applications due to misinterpretations.

## 6. Future Work
